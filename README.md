# I am going to become a Web Developer.

![background](background.jpg)

## After some searches on the web, I have started to study web development from the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

## At the same time, I am learning several technologies and tools.

## I am publishing my progress in two ways:

* formal - via repository project board (a project board and issues);
* informal - via my site on GitHub Pages (a blog and demos);

## Repositories:

* **[Antonklsv](https://github.com/Antonklsv/Antonklsv)** - main repository (this one);
* **[Antonklsv.github.io](https://github.com/Antonklsv/Antonklsv.github.io)** - my site on GitHub Pages;
* **[fcc-html-css](https://github.com/Antonklsv/fcc-html-css)** - freeCodeCamp html/css certification, the progress of the leaning and practic (micro projects);
* **[fcc-js](https://github.com/Antonklsv/fcc-js)** - freeCodeCamp javascript certification, the progress of the leaning and practic (micro projects);
* **[common](https://github.com/Antonklsv/common)** - web technologies and developer's tools, the progress of the learning and practics;
